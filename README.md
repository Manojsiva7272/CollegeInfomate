# 🤖 CollegeInfoMate – AI Receptionist Chatbot for Colleges

**CollegeInfoMate** is an AI-based chatbot that acts as a virtual receptionist for educational institutions. It allows visitors to scan a QR code and interact with an AI agent trained on college information to get instant responses about departments, admissions, facilities, and more.

## 📁 Project Structure

CollegeInfoMate is an AI-powered virtual receptionist chatbot developed to assist visitors and students by providing instant, accurate information about the college. Built using generative AI and large language models, the chatbot eliminates the need for a physical receptionist by allowing users to scan a QR code and interact through natural language.

The system retrieves information from the official college website, stores it in a FAISS vector database, and uses the Mistral LLM (via Ollama) to generate intelligent responses. This solution enhances campus accessibility, streamlines communication, and offers a modern AI-driven support experience for educational institutions.

- LLM-based chatbot using **Mistral via Ollama**
- College data stored in **FAISS vector DB**
